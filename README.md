# Twimba:
A Twitter variation built during the Module 5 of [The Frontend Developer Career Path]() on Scrimba.

## What did I build during the course?

During the course I've built a basic version of this app with a tutor. You can tweet and react to tweets of other people by liking and retweeting them. You can also undo these actions if you wish. The app updates the number of likes and retweets and changes the color of the icons.

I've learned so many new concepts compared to the [Paintagram](https://github.com/annziel/paintagram) project! These include `textarea`, `data attributes`, `event.target`, `.filter` and `.forEach` methods, `NOT (!) operator`, `classList`, `UUID`, popovers (`position` property), `element.style` method, importing and exporting data, and using CDN libraries. And all of these in only a few days!

## My customizations

I've built some extra features on my own. You can reply to a tweet and delete your tweets and comments. What's more, the app will save all your interactions for your next visit, so **remember to come back later**! You can also use the `Enter` key to tweet and retweet, or hold the `shift` key to write multiple lines (that last part required extra code in vanilla JavaScript).

To provide these features, I've learned about `.closest`, `.indexOf` and `.splice` methods, `Object.assign`, and accessing the coordinates of clicks relative to the page (`pageX/Y`), monitor (`screenX/Y`), or user's viewport (`clientX/Y`). I even wrote a few regular expressions!

## CAUTION:

Please don't include any sensitive information in your posts and comments. The data is stored in the `localStorage`, which is not the safest place in the universe ðŸ˜‰
